	<p class="question 1">
	1. Hello, My name is Juan Placencia. My programming experience started around 2 years.
	I found out I like to program when I was in a class from C++ programming. Since then 
	I've programmed in three languages:C++. Java, and JavaScript, and I have haven't written
	too many lines of code in either language except for java.
	(Java 1000+, C++ 300, JavaScript 100)

  <p class="Question 2">
    2. What I would like from this course would just expand my understanding of programming.
    If that make sense, to learn different how programming can be applied. This new found 
    knowledge would help me understand programming as a whole.
  </p>
